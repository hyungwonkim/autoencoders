# autoencoders
This repository hosts codes that compare autoencoders and principal component analysis using tensorflow and sci-kit learn. 

For actual financial data, I used the data from https://github.com/sebastianheinz/stockprediction. Analysis without autoencoders for financial data, I followed this post: https://medium.com/mlreview/a-simple-deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction-using-tensorflow-30505541d877

Analysis with autoencoder and its comparison to the case without autoencoder is my original work.
